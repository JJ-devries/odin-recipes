This will be my first project, I will be using html, css and maybe javascript.

The goal is to make a working and appealing webpage while using a repository on github. Further aspects this project should have are: 

   -Informative/well-structured commit messages
   -Working code (obviously)
   -Use of industry-standard methods
   -Understanding of basic git commands
   -A demonstration of the progression of my coding-abilities
   -A demonstration of my understanding of the lessons
